# Test configuration

## Introduction

Playwright has many options to configure how your tests are run. You can specify these options in the configuration file. Note that test runner options are **top-level**, do not put them into the `use` section.

## Basic Configuration

Here are some of the most common configuration options.

```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Look for test files in the "tests" directory, relative to this configuration file.
  testDir: 'tests',
  
  // Run all tests in parallel.
  fullyParallel: true,
  
  // Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.only in the source code.
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  
  // Retry on CI only.
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  
  // Opt out of parallel tests on CI.
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  
  // Reporter to use
  reporter: 'html',
  
  use: {
    // Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`.
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    
    // Collect trace when retrying the failed test.
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  
  // Configure projects for major browsers.
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
  
  // Run your local dev server before starting the tests.
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `testConfig.forbidOnly` | Whether to exit with an error if any tests are marked as `test.only`. Useful on CI. |
| `testConfig.fullyParallel` | Have all tests in all files to run in parallel. See [Parallelism](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel) and [Sharding](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding) for more details. |
| `testConfig.projects` | Run tests in multiple configurations or on multiple browsers |
| `testConfig.reporter` | Reporter to use. See [Test Reporters](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters) to learn more about which reporters are available. |
| `testConfig.retries` | The maximum number of retry attempts per test. See [Test Retries](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-retries) to learn more about retries. |
| `testConfig.testDir` | Directory with the test files. |
| `testConfig.use` | Options with `use{}` |
| `testConfig.webServer` | To launch a server during the tests, use the `webServer` option |
| `testConfig.workers` | The maximum number of concurrent worker processes to use for parallelizing tests. Can also be set as percentage of logical CPU cores, e.g. `'50%'`. See [Parallelism](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel) and [Sharding](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding) for more details. |

## Filtering Tests

Filter tests by glob patterns or regular expressions.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Glob patterns or regular expressions to ignore test files.
  testIgnore: '*test-assets',
  
  // Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files.
  testMatch: '*todo-tests/*.spec.ts',
});
```

### Filtering Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `testConfig.testIgnore` | Glob patterns or regular expressions that should be ignored when looking for the test files. For example, `'*test-assets'` |
| `testConfig.testMatch` | Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files. For example, `'*todo-tests/*.spec.ts'`. By default, Playwright runs `.*(test|spec).(js|ts|mjs)` files. |

## Advanced Configuration

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Folder for test artifacts such as screenshots, videos, traces, etc.
  outputDir: 'test-results',
  
  // path to the global setup files.
  globalSetup: require.resolve('./global-setup'),
  
  // path to the global teardown files.
  globalTeardown: require.resolve('./global-teardown'),
  
  // Each test is given 30 seconds.
  timeout: 30000,
});
```

### Advanced Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `testConfig.globalSetup` | Path to the global setup file. This file will be required and run before all the tests. It must export a single function. |
| `testConfig.globalTeardown` | Path to the global teardown file. This file will be required and run after all the tests. It must export a single function. |
| `testConfig.outputDir` | Folder for test artifacts such as screenshots, videos, traces, etc. |
| `testConfig.timeout` | Playwright enforces a [timeout](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts) for each test, 30 seconds by default. Time spent by the test function, test fixtures and beforeEach hooks is included in the test timeout. |

## Expect Options

Configuration for the expect assertion library.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  expect: {
    // Maximum time expect() should wait for the condition to be met.
    timeout: 5000,
    
    toHaveScreenshot: {
      // An acceptable amount of pixels that could be different, unset by default.
      maxDiffPixels: 10,
    },
    
    toMatchSnapshot: {
      // An acceptable ratio of pixels that are different to the
      // total amount of pixels, between 0 and 1.
      maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.1,
    },
  },
});
```

### Expect Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `testConfig.expect` | [Web first assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions) like `expect(locator).toHaveText()` have a separate timeout of 5 seconds by default. This is the maximum time the `expect()` should wait for the condition to be met. Learn more about [test and expect timeouts](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts) and how to set them for a single test. |
| `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()` | Configuration for the `expect(locator).toHaveScreenshot()` method. |
| `expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()` | Configuration for the `expect(locator).toMatchSnapshot()` method. |
